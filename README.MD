# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A React-based dashboard that visualizes stock market prices alongside sentiment analysis data from social media.

## Overview

This application combines historical stock price data with sentiment analysis results generated by FinBERT from social media posts. The goal is to provide insights into how public sentiment impacts stock price movements.

### Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT

FinBERT is a variant of BERT specifically trained on financial news and statements, optimized to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) within financial text data. In this application, FinBERT is utilized to analyze Twitter data, providing sentiment labels that reflect public perception related to specific stocks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd stock-sentiment-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser to the local development server** (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Processing and Reclassifying Tweet Sentiment

The `tweet_processing.ipynb` Jupyter notebook allows you to:

- Reprocess raw tweets
- Adjust sentiment classifications if necessary
- Retrain or fine-tune the FinBERT sentiment analysis model

Use this notebook when new tweet data is acquired or if reclassification of sentiment scores is required.

## Building for Production

To build an optimized production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.
