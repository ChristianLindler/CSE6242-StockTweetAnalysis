# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## DESCRIPTION
This package holds a React-based dashboard that visualizes the relationship between Stock sentiment on Twitter and stock price movements. The app combines historical stock price data with sentiment analysis results generated by FinBERT from Tweets. The goal is to provide insights into how public sentiment impacts stock price movements. This project is deployed at https://christianlindler.github.io/CSE6242-StockTweetAnalysis/

FinBERT is a variant of BERT specifically trained on financial news and statements, optimized to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) within financial text data. In this application, FinBERT is utilized to analyze Twitter data, providing sentiment labels that reflect public perception related to specific stocks.


## INSTALLATION
The web app is deployed and can be accessed at [https://christianlindler.github.io/CSE6242-StockTweetAnalysis/](https://christianlindler.github.io/CSE6242-StockTweetAnalysis/).  
To run it locally, follow these steps:

### Datasets
Our project makes use of two datasets: values of top NASDAQ companies (2010–2020) and tweets about these companies (2015–2020).  
The code to clean, preprocess, and classify the tweets is provided via two Jupyter notebooks in the repository, but preprocessed datasets are also available.

Place these CSV files into the `stock-sentiment-app/public/` folder:
